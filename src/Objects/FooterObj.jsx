Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made Myntra the online platform that it is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts was conceived in 2007 but transitioned into a full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years. By 2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian and international brands to its platform, and this has only grown in number each passing year. Today Myntra sits on top of the online fashion game with an astounding social media following, a loyalty program dedicated to its customers, and tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals."
